# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

## Introduction


This is my first project for the Udacity Nanodegree "Cloud DevOps using Microsoft Azure" .

The task is to deploy a web application to Azure. The application is self-contained, but the infrastructure to deploy is need in a custimizable way.
It should be deployed as an Iaas and across multiple virtual machines.

Therefor I created a server image with Packer and used Terraform to create a template for deploying a scalable cluster of servers with a load balacer to manage the incoming traffic.
Further I added a policy to deny any deployments of resources without a tag.
